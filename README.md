# DBMS Data Structures & Algorithms

The goal of this project is to implement block-level algorithms and data structures to **insert**, **search** and **delete** entries in a database. The management of entries and indexes is performed with 3 different ways:

1. Heap files (HP_lib)
2. Static hashtable (HT_lib)
3. Secondary hashtable (SHT_lib)

Each folder contains an executable to demonstrate the basic functionalities of the implemented data structures and algorithms. For each directory, the following commands can be used:

 - **make** : Creates the executable 'main' which is the demo of the respective data structure
 - **make run** : Creates and executes 'main'
 - **make clean** : Deletes all object and executable files
